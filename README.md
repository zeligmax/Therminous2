# 🎛️ Therminous2 – Mobile Sensor Synthesizer

**Therminous2** is a research-driven Android application that transforms your smartphone into a real-time audio synthesizer. It captures live data from your phone's built-in sensors—**Altitude**, **Latitude**, **Longitude**, and **Gyroscope (X, Y, Z)**—to generate evolving electronic sounds inspired by the **theremin**.

This project explores the relationship between **motion, space, and sound**, offering a new way to interpret physical data through continuous, dynamic audio.

## 🔬 Project Description

Therminous2 is part of an ongoing artistic research project led by **Zeligmax**, focused on developing accessible, sensor-based sound tools. The app maps physical data to sonic parameters using basic waveform synthesis, creating an expressive and interactive sound experience without the need for touch input.

Possible applications include:
- Experimental music and sound design
- Performative installations
- Accessibility and sensory augmentation
- Data sonification for research or education

## 📱 Features

- 🎚️ **Real-time sound synthesis** from 6 motion and location parameters  
- 🎵 Multiple waveform options: *sine*, *square*, *triangle*, and *theremin-style continuous tones*  
- 🌍 Supports negative and wide-range geographic values  
- 🎛️ **Theremin Mode**: cleaner, smoother tone behavior  
- 📊 Live visualization of sensor values  
- 🔧 Adjustable **sensitivity** and **waveform type**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Download APK

You can download and install the latest APK release [from the Releases tab](https://github.com/zeligmax/Therminous2/releases) or by sideloading it on your Android device.

### Permissions

The app requires:
- **Location access** (for Altitude, Latitude, Longitude)
- **Physical activity and motion sensors**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Altitude, Latitude, Longitude** → influence pitch, tone range, or modulation  
- **Gyroscope (X, Y, Z)** → control vibrato, amplitude, waveform shifts, or audio filters  

The audio engine is designed to generate **constant sound streams**, responding immediately and fluidly to even subtle changes in sensor values.

---

## 🎨 Design

Therminous2 features a minimalist interface inspired by early sci-fi aesthetics (Star Wars, *2001: A Space Odyssey*) and analog synthesizers. The focus is on function, clarity, and direct interaction with invisible data.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Android Studio (Kotlin / Java)**
- **AudioTrack API** for low-latency sound synthesis
- **SensorManager** for real-time data access

---

## 📚 Research Context

This app is part of a broader research and artistic project titled **“Wheels On Motion”**, investigating how wheelchair mobility and urban barriers can be expressed through sound. By using geolocation and motion data, Therminous2 helps turn everyday physical experience into a musical language.
